## Distribution of Medical Equipment and PPE for the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil 

### Motivation 

Brazil has a public healthcare system that assists approximately 70% of the population, which has no access to private health insurance. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a large pressure on a system that is already saturated. This project shows the efforts made to prepare the system to receive the COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, in several parts of the country were reported cases of patients that died without having access to an ICU, because the hospitals were already full. 

### Description 

This is an EDA project in which it will be shown data on the distribution of mechanical ventilators and personal protection equipment in Brazil. 

The data source is the Brazilian Open Data Portal, links below in Portuguese:
 - [Ventilators Dataset](https://dados.gov.br/dataset/distribuicao-de-respiradores) - last update considered for this project on December, 17th, 2020. 
 - [PPE Dataset](https://dados.gov.br/dataset/distribuicao-de-equipamentos-de-protecao-individual-e-insumos-covid-19) - last update considered for this project on August, 17th, 2020. 

Data is visualized using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. The plots generated with plotly were published online on the Datapane platform.
