## Last FM Recommendation System

#### Description 

This project aims to create a recommendation system in PySpark using data from Last fm users. The dataset considered in the study was the [Last-FM 360K Dataset](http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationDataset/index.html)
 which contains data on 360K users, comprising the following information:
 * User id
 * Artist id
 * Artist Name
 * Number of plays by user 
 
 ### Motivation
 
 Recommendation systems are everywhere. The great challenges around this type of system is the amount of data you use to build them. This project is an opportunity to train my knowledge on how to use PySpark to analyse and build machine learning models on large datasets.
